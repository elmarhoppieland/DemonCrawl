## Changes the current scene to the given [param node].
static func change_scene_to_node(node: Node) -> void:

## Changes the current scene to the specified [param file]. Returns the created
## [Node] after instantiating it.
## [br][br][b]Note:[/b] The scene will be instantiated at the end of the current frame.
## Therefore, this is a coroutine and should be called with [code]await[/code] if
## the return value is needed.

## Changes the current scene to the specified [param packed_scene]. Returns the
## created [Node] after instantiating it.
## [br][br][b]Note:[/b] The scene will be instantiated at the end of the current frame.
## therefore, this is a coroutine and should be called with [code]await[/code] if

## Changes the current scene a new [Node], in the following way:
## [br][br]First, the current scene is removed from the scene tree.
## [br][br]At the end of the current frame (see [method Promsise.defer]), the
## [param instantiator] is called. Its return value is then added to the scene tree.
## [br][br][b]Note:[/b] The instantiator is called at the end of the current frame.
## Therefore, this is a coroutine and should be called with [code]await[/code] if
## the return value is needed.

## Reloads the current scene.
## [br][br][b]Note:[/b] This is the same as [method SceneTree.reload_current_scene].
